Project Title:  Creating a To-Do app web application
Description:  To-Do lists are the lists that we generally use to maintain our day to day tasks or list of everything that we have to do, with the most important tasks at the top of the list, and the least important tasks at the bottom. It is helpful in planning our daily schedules .We can add more tasks at any time and  delete  a task that is completed. The four major tasks that we can perform in a To-Do list are:
                   1. Add Tasks
                   2. Update Tasks
                   3. Read Tasks
                  4. Delete Tasks
Project Resources:   In this we use front end tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for example:
Index.HTml:  In this, we will create the basic structure of the project.
Style.css      : In this, we use to style the web application.
app.js          :  In this, we will add the logical section of our project where we will define functions that will define functions that will perform the tasks described in the list above.
Backend tools : using Django
. Create a web app using Django
.Build a data model with one to many relationships
.Use the Django admin interface to explore your data model and add test data
.Design templates for displaying your lists
.control the Django URL dispatcher by creating URL configurations
Database: A simple To-Do list application that takes tasks submitted by user in a form and saves them in my SQL database. As usual, let’s create our database. Create a database called To-Do and in it, create a table called Tasks. Tasks table has only two fields namely:
.id-int (10)
.task-varchar (255)
Now create two files:
.index-php
.style.css
Github functionalities:  To associate your repository with the todolist topic, visit your repo’s landing page and select “manage topics”.
Project Benefits: Collaborative coding is one of the key benefits of GitHub, and it has transformed the way Developers work together on code. With GitHub, multiple developers can work on the same codebase simultaneously, making it easier to manage large projects with many contributors.
